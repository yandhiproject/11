<h3>Why unblock?</h3>
<hr>
<p>Censorship on school computers can have a negative impact on students' education and personal growth. When schools block access to certain websites or content, they limit students' ability to explore and learn about different topics. This can be particularly harmful in subjects like history, social studies, and science, where students need access to a wide range of information to fully understand the material. Additionally, censorship can stifle creativity and critical thinking, as students are not able to explore different perspectives and ideas. By limiting access to information, schools are essentially limiting students' ability to learn and grow, which can have long-term consequences for their academic and personal development.

</p>
<br>
<p>Furthermore, censorship on school computers can also be seen as a violation of students' rights to free speech and expression. Students have the right to access information and express their opinions, even if those opinions are unpopular or controversial. By censoring certain websites or content, schools are essentially telling students what they can and cannot think or say. This can create a culture of fear and self-censorship, where students are afraid to express their opinions or explore new ideas. In order to create a healthy and open learning environment, schools should encourage free speech and expression, rather than censoring it.
